# SDSLabs Team Page [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdslabs/team.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/sdslabs/team)

Uses Masonry and Jekyll.

## Notice
* Please resize your images to 400px width before adding them to the repo. This
only increases the repository size unnecessarily as we have to keep both images
(original+resized) in the repo forever.
* Please add images with filesize < 250 KB only. Otherwise, the latency for
the team page becomes large. Run the test provided to check if all images
are less than 250 KB.
